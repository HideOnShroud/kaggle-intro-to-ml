## Explore Your Data

**File**: `exercise-explore-your-data.ipynb`

In this exercise, you will learn how to load and explore your dataset. Key topics include:
- Loading data into a Pandas DataFrame
- Exploring data with basic statistics and visualizations
- Identifying and handling missing values

## Your First Machine Learning Model

**File**: `exercise-your-first-machine-learning-model.ipynb`

This notebook guides you through building your first machine learning model using a simple decision tree. You will learn about:
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Training a decision tree model
- Making predictions
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy

## Model Validation

**File**: `exercise-model-validation.ipynb`

Model validation is crucial for understanding how well your model generalizes to unseen data. In this exercise, you will:
- Learn about train-test splits and cross-validation
- Implement cross-validation to assess model performance
- Compare different validation strategies

## Underfitting and Overfitting

**File**: `exercise-underfitting-and-overfitting.ipynb`

Understanding underfitting and overfitting is key to building robust models. This notebook covers:
- The bias-variance tradeoff
- Diagnosing underfitting and overfitting with learning curves
- Techniques to address these issues, such as adjusting model complexity and gathering more data

## Random Forests

**File**: `exercise-random-forests.ipynb`

Random forests are powerful ensemble methods. In this exercise, you will:
- Understand the concept of ensemble learning
- Build and evaluate a random forest model
- Compare the performance of random forests to single decision trees

## Machine Learning Competitions

**File**: `exercise-machine-learning-competitions.ipynb`

Participating in machine learning competitions can be a great way to improve your skills. This notebook covers:
- Introduction to Kaggle competitions
- Best practices for approaching competitions
- Building and submitting competition entries
